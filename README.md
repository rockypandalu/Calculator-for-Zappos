# Google App Engine Request Log Investigation
This is a demo for the information we can get from Google App Engine's Request Log

## Data Introduction
1. Project ID
2. Module (Service) ID
3. Client IP
4. Request Start and End Time
5. Latency (Computing Hour When Network Time is Neglectable Comparing with Computation Time)
6. Response Size
7. Access URL
8. Any Log Written by Application (only in Standard Environment)

## Demo WorkFlow
1. When a request is made, a workflow ID is generated by calling the Google Endpoint
2. The workflow ID is writen as log
3. When the response is made from server, the server write and store the Request Log, the workflow ID written in step 2 will also be writen in the Request Log
4. By setting in Stackdriver -> Logging -> Export, we can export all request log to BigQuery
5. We will query all Request Logs related to a workflow ID, show the client IP and sum the total computing hours

## Deploy
1. Build a project in Google Cloud Platform and enable Billing
2. Open this folder through Pycharm
3. Change the application name to be the same as the project name
4. Click Tools -> Google App Engine -> Upload Google App Engine application
5. After authentication through website, the app is deployed on the Google App Engine

# Calculator in iOS
